# What is pos.js?

pos.js is a Javascript library that serves as a physics engine for your project.

# Installation

You can't install pos.js yet, but it will be an npm package when version 1.0.0 is released; yet, you can access pos.js through jsDelivr

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/doctor-diebo/pos/pos.js"></script>
```

# Repository organization

This repo is organized in a weird way (oops), the server folder contains code for a server that will (in the near future) be hosted with examples of how to use pos.js and some creatives uses or pos.js. the actual file that you can implement in your projects is `pos.js`. There is a `package.json` file for the npm package that will be released upon release of version 1.0.0.

# Thanks for using pos.js :)
