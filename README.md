# What is pos.js?

pos.js is a Javascript library that serves as a physics engine for your project.

# Why use pos.js

pos.js is different because it uses position to calculate everything. Yes, this is different, pos.js does **_not_** create or display any graphics whatsoever...this means you can integrate pos.js to any project using any graphics library you want.
